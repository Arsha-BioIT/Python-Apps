# Probiotic App (Just Basic Interface) (to be developed)

## Overview
The **Probiotic App** is a web-based application designed to provide insights into probiotics, their health benefits, and potential strains based on user input. It integrates bioinformatics tools and databases to help users understand the best probiotic strains for specific conditions.

## Features
- **User Input & Recommendations**: Users can input health conditions and receive probiotic strain recommendations.
- **Microbiome Analysis**: Allows users to analyze gut microbiome data (if applicable).

- **Web Interface**: Developed using **Flask** for easy access.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for ML, BioPython for sequence analysis)
- **Flask** (for web UI)
- **HTML, CSS** (for custom styling if needed)


## Usage
- Open the app in your browser.
- Enter symptoms or upload microbiome data (if supported).
- Get probiotic recommendations and insights.
- Explore interactive visualizations.

## Future Scope
- Integration with **microbiome sequencing data**.
- More advanced **AI-based recommendations**.
- Mobile app version.
- **Database** (SQLite/PostgreSQL for storing probiotic strains)
- **Plotly / Matplotlib** (for visualization)
- **Strain Database**: A curated list of probiotic strains with scientific references.
- **AI/ML Predictions** *(Optional)*: Machine learning-based suggestions for personalized probiotics.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Graphs and charts for better data interpretation.

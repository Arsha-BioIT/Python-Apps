Flask Web App Setup

Uses Flask to create a web application with endpoints for uploading files, normalizing data, and visualizing results.
File Upload Handling (/upload)

Accepts CSV file uploads.
Reads the CSV file using Pandas.
Extracts column names and passes them to an HTML template for selection.
Normalization (/normalize)

Applies various normalization techniques (MinMax, Standard, Robust, etc.).
Handles transformations like log, square root, Box-Cox, and Yeo-Johnson.
Saves the transformed data as a CSV file and allows users to download it.
Visualization (/visualize)

Generates histograms for a selected column.
Converts the plot to a Base64-encoded image and renders it in an HTML template.
Ensures Safe File Storage

Stores uploaded files in an uploads folder (created automatically if missing).
